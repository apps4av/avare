Avare (pronounced "AvAir") is a free moving aviation map. 

<b>Overview</b>
Avare is a free aviation situational awareness moving map aviation GPS app first developed in Boston, and donated to aviators and open source programmers. There are no push ads, no special permissions, and no hidden charges or subscription fees.

<b>Basic features</b> in Avare include offline (after download) airport quick reference including local sunrise/set, fuel availability, and full FAA C.Supplement (A/FD) pages; active GPS location on all FAA VFR Sectionals, WACs, TACs, IFR Plates and other charts including Airport Diagrams, and an Open Street Maps depiction of each airport Area including those not included in FAA materials. 

Avare enables manual browsing of all charts and all other materials even with GPS turned off (Simulation mode). Current FAA internet (and ADS-B In, with receiver) weather METARs, NEXRAD, TAFs, TFRs, and Flight Plans are supported too, along with a detailed Near list of airports, live 3D terrain or chart view and other extras. Permissions required include Internet access for downloading free current FAA materials and information, Storage access for storing materials, Bluetooth for new features like ADS-B, and GPS location to provide the moving map feature.

<b>Charts</b> 
Moving Map FAA charts with or without GPS, download only the charts you need; 
Ground track & destination bearing, GPS speed & altitude, distance, user waypoints, destination & track indicators; 
Track lines, rubber banding, and recordings; ETA, CSup (A/FD), Airport Diagrams; and bearing & distance to/from any point on the chart. 

<b>Display</b>
Display options include Landscape and Portrait mode, plus North Up or limited Track Up (text on the free FAA charts rotates with the chart in Track Up mode). All the Avare apps and all features are free.

<b>Hardware</b>
Avare works on most Android devices. Some devices will work even better with an inexpensive external WAAS GPS, and works with most ADS-B receivers including the powerful inexpensive StratuX (see our Forum about StratuS brand limitations). Avare works on even many small or older Android devices although of course best results and some features like the “PFD” benefit from newer devices, and an inexpensive external Bluetooth GPS may improve reliability and accuracy. Some users prefer the larger screen area on a tablet device.

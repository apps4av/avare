 <h3 style="text-align: center;">Notice</h3>
 All GPS applications on any <b>handheld non-certified devices</b> like
 smartphones and tablets are <b><em>not approved by the FAA for IFR</em></b> flights.
 None of the operating systems on such devices are tested according to rigorous
 FAA standards, hence any software running on them is unfit for
 use as a primary flight navigation tool. It is unwise to solely rely
 on any such device or any app running on one, during the critical
 phases of a flight.
 <p>
  Please do not download any charts/plates that you do not need. Downloading
  only the needed files will help us keep server hosting costs down, which along
  with donations helps us keep Avare and chart updates free to all. Thank you.
 </p>
 The user must ensure that Avare is always updated to the latest
 version, and <b>ensure that all Avare databases and charts are kept current</b>.
 If Avare and its databases and charts are not of the exact same
 version, the GPS position displayed may be inaccurate, because <b>the FAA
  sometimes changes the format</b> of their materials. Avare does not
 automatically fetch any databases and charts when they are expired, so
 it is the user's sole responsibility to update any expired charts and
 databases. To do so, ensure that your device has an internet connection and
 then just <b>press the Map, Options, Download and Update buttons</b> in Avare.<br>

 <h3 style="text-align: center;"><a name="0.1_Quick">Quick Start</a> -
  Intro<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><br style="font-weight: bold;"> </h3>

 <p>•When you first launch Avare, after reading the disclaimer
  just click OK if you agree to the terms. Before using Avare the first time,
  you must have an internet connection on your device (WiFi or Data) to
  Download the free Database and at least one of the free charts. Later you can add any airport diagrams,
  terminal procedures, and other files you'll need. <b>Please get only the materials you
   need</b> because downloading all available materials will use both your
  online resources and ours, overloading our servers. Help us keep Avare
  and the FAA resources free for all users.</p>

 <p>To get these free resources: Press the <b>Options button</b> (square button on
  the lower left side of the Map screen), press the Download button,
  select one or more items you need from the list,
  then press the Get button to begin downloading. <i>Note that the Option
   button is only available in the Map view, so if you don't see it just
   press the Map button at bottom-left first and Options will appear
   above it.</i> When you're
  done Downloading, just hit the Back key on your device to see the
  Map view. After doing this, no data connection is required to use any of the
  materials you've downloaded with Avare.</p>

 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Notes:
 </p><ul><li>New charts and
  features are being added frequently, so check often to ensure that you
  have the latest Avare version and Downloads. In the Downloads screen,
  any categories containing items that are outdated will be shown in red.
  Any red items indicate that you need to ensure your device has an
  internet connection and then press the <b>Update</b> button.
 </li>

  <li>Sometimes after installing or
   upgrading Avare,
   you may be taken to the Download screen
   automatically. After pressing Update to ensure that the Databases file and
   any other materials you need are current (green Checkmark), press the
   Back key to exit to the Map screen.</li>

  <li>If you forgot to ensure that GPS
   is on in your device's Settings, Avare may remind you to do that
   because it is unable to display your position accurately without GPS.
   To possibly speed up internal GPS acquisition on some devices, you
   can ensure that all services (WiFi, cell service, and data) are at least
   temporarily turned on too. Once required data has been Downloaded
   and GPS location has been acquired, Avare works fine in "Airplane
   Mode" with cell and data service turned off and only GPS turned on.</li></ul>


 <p>•<b>Move around</b> or change zoom on the
  Sectionals simply by holding a point on the chart and dragging or two
  finger pinching, just like when viewing photos on your device. If your
  version of Avare displays a minus/plus rocker button when you press
  the Options button, that will provide extended zoom capability by
  changing the zoom range available using the pinch zoom method.</p>

 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Note: Either the default horizontal
  Landscape or vertical Portrait mode display is available, selected in
  Preferences.</p>

 <p>•The square <b>Center</b> button at the
  bottom-center of the screen will center the location icon and continue
  tracking your current GPS location (if the GPS is on and has acquired
  your location) on the "moving map" chart.</p>

 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Note: While GPS is acquired in Avare,
  the map will constantly track from your currently displayed location.
  This is very handy in flight, because you can drag the map to place the
  location indicator icon at any spot on the screen (or even completely off
  the screen) and the map will continue tracking beneath it. So for example
  if you are flying northwest, you can put the location icon at the southeast
  corner of the screen and see a greater distance ahead on the map at any
  given zoom level. To instantly center your location icon again, just press
  the Center button.</p>

 <p>•The "<b>Pan</b>" (Pan/Draw) button allows you to jot quick
  notes on charts. In the Maps screen, tap the Pan button at the lower-right.
  When the Pan button changes to the Draw button, the charts will
  not pan, and the Map screen becomes a touch operated pen for writing or
  drawing on charts. Draw or write notes on the screen with your finger.
  Notes length is limited due to memory size.</p>

 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">To erase all notes and drawings in Draw
  mode, long press the screen and then press the <b>Clear</b> button
  that appears.</p>

 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">To temporarily hide your notes/drawings and return to
  normal Map functioning (Pan mode), just tap the Draw (Pan) button again.</p>

 <p>•<b>Long-press</b> any point on the chart to display a page containing:
 <li style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Action</b> buttons row:
  <b>->D</b> sets up the point as Destination,
  <b>+Plan</b> adds the point to the Plan,
  <b>Plate</b> displays airport's plates,
  <b>A/FD</b> displays a synthetic Chart Supplement page (the top dropdown opens scanned Chart Supplement),
  <b>X</b> to close the page.</li>
 <li style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Airport FAA code</b> or <b>GPS coordinates</b> of the point
  in <i>[name@]lat&lon</i> format; <i>name</i> is optional,</li>
 <li style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Position</b>: distance, compass direction and GPS bearing <b><u>FROM</u></b> the point,
  followed by GPS bearing from your position <b><u>TO</u></b> the point, as well as <b>NavAids</b> (VOR) locations in format (VORName)(BearingFrom)(Distance).
  Useful when contacting ATC or making CTAF calls.</li>

 <br>If the point is an airport, weather is downloaded/not expired:
 <li style="padding-left: 30px;">the airport's <b>METAR</b>
  or the closest METAR found in a airport's radius (configurable in Preferences/Weather),</li>
 <li style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Performance</b> data for use at the airport:
  density altitude, the best runway and its head/cross winds calculated using the METAR winds,</li>
 <li style="padding-left: 30px;">the airport's <b>TAF</b>,
 <li style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Winds/Temp. Aloft</b> forecast reported by the closest meteorological station,</li>

 <br>For all points:
 <li style="padding-left: 30px;">nearby <b>Pireps</b></li>
 <li style="padding-left: 30px;">nearby <b>Special Use Airspace</b> (SUA),</li>
 <li style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>data source</b> for the weather and SUA:
  data downloaded from internet or data retrieved with ADSB,</li>
 <li style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>data timestamp</b>.</li>
 </p>

  <a name="0.1_Find"></a>
 <p>•The "<b>Find</b>" button in the bottom Menu
  activates a search box for a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">4-digit</span>
  Destination Airport code (or Navaid code, Fix code, etc.)
  that Avare uses to display a course, bearing, etc. This
  code also determines the Destination airport Avare uses when you display A/FD
  info. If you do not remember the airport code for an airport,
  enter part of its facility name to search for it. Avare offers some capability
  for offline facility search (try using just the first letter and
  scrolling down through the list) and when online, Avare automatically taps into
  Google Maps if needed to search for airports and even cities or complete street
  addresses (see "<b><a title="Fly To" href="#0.1_Landmarks">Fly There</a></b>"
  in the Help menu above). You can also specify radial/DME pairs in
  destination like BOS275010 for BOS VOR, 275 degree radial, 10 miles.<br>
 </p>

 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>To input a Destination
  airport</b>, just tap the Find button in the Menu and then input the
  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>four</b></span>
  digit airport code (example: KLAX, <em>not</em> LAX).</p>

 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Note that a selection list of your
  recently input Destination codes is displayed before you
  begin to input a new one. Familiar symbols are used to indicate the various
  types of Destination codes such as VORs and intersections. Airports have an
  empty round symbol. For convenience in selecting VORs, etc., airports are
  sorted toward the bottom since they can be quickly selected with a long-press
  in Map view.</p>

 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>
  To Delete a Destination</b>, from the list of
  previously used destinations in the search list, long-press it, and a
  list of buttons will appear. Select "Delete" to delete that
  destination.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>To clear a
  Destination</b> once it has been set,
  long press on the Next Text Field on Map view, to clear the currently set
  destination.<br> </p>

 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Note that when there is no Destination set,
  the <b>current chart name</b> may be displayed at the top-left (e.g. "Los Angeles"
  to indicate that Avare's currently displayed location is on the LA Sectional).

 </p><p>•Press the <b>Options button</b> (square button on
  the lower left side of the Map screen), and a list of
  buttons for additional features and Preferences will appear.</p>

 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">≡ The "<b>Preferences</b>"
  button in the Options list
  displays a list where you can choose among available Preferences
  (details below).</p>

 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">≡ The <b>Help</b> button
  in the Options list activates a
  web browser app to display in-app Help with a few links to online resources.
  Press the Back key on your Android device to return to Avare.</p>

 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">≡ There may be an <b>Extended
  Zoom</b> (- +) button in
  the Options list, that enables you to extend the zoom range provided by using
  the normal two-finger pinch zoom feature.

 </p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">≡ The <b>North Up/Track Up</b>
  button in the Options list
  provides some capability to change the map display orientation. Because
  Avare uses the free official FAA charts, text on the charts will rotate along
  with the chart.

 </p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">≡ The <b>Navigate/Simulation</b>
  button in the Options list
  toggles Avare's use of GPS for positioning the map. In the default Navigate mode,
  if GPS is on and location is acquired Avare will track your location.

 </p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">≡ The <b>Chart Type</b>
  button in the Options list
  shows the chart type currently displayed. Sectional is the default.

 </p><p><b>•To browse charts</b> freely without reference
  to your GPS location, press the Options button, tap the Preferences
  button, and select <b>Simulation Mode</b>.
  Then you can zoom in or out, scroll and pan freely, or quickly zip to
  any location simply by inputting a Destination as described
  above. </p>

 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Notes: Simulation Mode works without any need for
  cell or data access or GPS. If GPS is on and has acquired a "lock" on
  your location, it will retain lock in Simulation Mode while Avare is active and the
  device is on. This is helpful because once internal GPS is lost, some
  devices won't re-acquire without a cell or WiFi signal (such as when aloft in many
  areas). In Simulation Mode, Find will center the
  chart display at the airport code you input, and you can then browse
  from there or input another airport code. After browsing, to re-center the map on
  the current Destination (if any is set), just tap the Center button. When you use
  Preferences to turn Simulation Mode off again, the display will return to your
  current GPS location if available.</p>

 <b>•To track a course to destination</b> enter a
 destination, and a magenta great circle route will appear from your current
 GPS location to that destination. Once set, the magenta route line doesn't
 move with the aircraft location. A dashed black and white Destination
 track line shows the current bearing to the destination. A red dashed line
 shows the current aircraft ground track. Align the two dashed lines with the solid
 magenta line for the shortest route to your Destination. If your location
 has diverged from the magenta course line you can use Find to re-select
 your Destination. You can also just fly so that the two dashed lines are
 superimposed in alignment.

 <p><b><i>Main Avare Screens</i></b><br>
  The main screens in Avare are selected via the<b>Menu</b>
  row of buttons across the bottom:</p>

 <p>•The "<b>Map</b>" Button in the Menu at the bottom of the
  screen displays the currently selected chart type at the current location. Map is the
  default screen in Avare, and will often be displayed when using the Back key on
  your device from within another Avare screen such as the Find screen.</p>

 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Note: if Avare is unable to acquire your GPS
  position or you have no Destination
  selected, a black screen may be displayed. If so, you can display a chart by using
  Preferences to select Simulation Mode and then using Find to select a Destination
  that is on a chart you have previously installed via Download.</p>

 <p>•The "<b>Plate</b>" Button in the Menu at the bottom of the
  screen displays the FAA airport diagrams, and terminal procedures for
  the currently selected Destination, selected airports in Flight Plan,
  Near and Find modes, and auto loads the Plate on landing roll out, if the option is
  selected in Preferences, and if in Map view mode.<br> </p>

 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>To view an Airport Diagram (AD)</b>
  first Download the collection of ADs that covers the location of your intended Destination.
  For example, "California" for LAX.
  Then input the Destination airport code in the Find screen as described above,
  tap the "Plates" Button, then select "AIRPORT-DIAGRAM" from the drop down list
  and Avare will display it,  provided that you have Downloaded the relevant AD file
  and the FAA provides a diagram for your selected Destination airport.
  Note that the "<b>GPS Taxi</b>" feature in Avare can indicate your current
  location on an airport (see details in the Airport Diagram section of Avare's Help). </p>

 <p>•The "<b>A/FD</b>" Button in the Menu at the bottom of the screen
  displays the airport info for the currently selected Destination
  airport in text format.</p>

 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">To get airport
  <b>(A/FD) text info</b>, first input a Destination airport in Map view as
  described above, then tap the "A/FD" Button and scroll through the info. Note that
  if you have Downloaded the "A/FD Images" file for your Destination airport (e.g.
  "A/FD SW" for LAX), the drop down A/FD bar on the top of the A/FD screen is
  used to select between the text and graphical versions of the A/FD. The regional
  graphical A/FD files are typically quite large, but can provide information beyond
  what's contained in the smaller FAA text version that covers all FAA regions and is
  included in Avare's required Databases file.<br> </p>

 <p>•The "<b>Find</b>" Button in the Menu at the bottom
  of the screen enables you to search for a Destination airport, VOR or
  waypoint.<br> </p>

 <p>•The "<b>WXB</b>"
  "WXB" Allows pilots to file, cancel flight plans, and get weather briefings from the FAA, similar to DUATS, DUAT.

 </p><p>•The "<b>Plan</b>" The "Plan" Button in the Menu at the bottom of the screen enables you to do flight planning online or offline in flight, and get WX from FAA for the planned route, (see details in that section of this Help file). </p>

 <p>•The "<b>Near</b>" button in the Menu will display
  a selectable list of airports nearest to your current GPS location.</p>

 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">To use the Near feature, first ensure
  that GPS is on and has acquired your location, then press the Near Button
  at the bottom of the screen. The airports are listed by increasing
  distance with nearest at the top. Each airport's name, code, distance,
  bearing, and 100LL fuel (if available) is displayed (Jet A may be
  shown as "A" alone, or as 100LLA indicating availability of both
  fuels).

 </p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">Note: To select an airport on the list
  as Avare's current <b>Destination</b>, simply press the name
  of that airport and then press the button that pops out, to select the code
  displayed on that button as your Destination.</p>

 <p>•The "<b>GPS</b>" Button in the Menu at the bottom
  of the screen enables you to monitor the current status of the GPS system
  currently in use by Avare on your device. Note that this differs from the
  GPS/Simulation button that selects whether Avare is currently using
  GPS to display your current location.</p>

 <hr size="1">
 <h3 style="text-align: center;"><a name="0.1_Help">Help</a>
  - More Intro</h3>

 <p>•<b>Text information</b> is displayed at the top of the
  Map display screen, when your GPS position is acquired
  and you have input a valid Destination.

 </p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">In the top row: Destination (or chart
  name if no Destination is selected) at the left; Distance from GPS location, time
  to Destination direct at current GPS speed, GPS bearing to
  Destination at the right.

 </p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">In the second row: GPS elevation
  MSL at the left; GPS ground speed and GPS
  heading at the right.</p>

 <p>•<b>GPS Status</b> information is available from
  the Tools screen. This feature is
  helpful in positioning your GPS device for best reception, and in
  troubleshooting any GPS problems. </p>

 <p>•<b>TFRs</b> that you have recently fetched using
  Update in Download via internet from the FAA are automatically
  displayed as red graphics on charts by default. If you long-press
  the red indicator at the top-center of a TFR shape, text for that TFR will be
  displayed in the TFR section. It is user's responsibility to Update the
  latest TFRs from the download list under the Databases group.
  <br>Even though Avare gets the TFR data from the FAA website, you must call your FSS for the latest TFR data, as the FAA TFR website may not be current.</p>

 <p>•<b>Runway Extensions</b> (if set in Preferences)
  show 6 degree approach
  to all runways at the airport currently set as Destination. Note that
  due to variations in the FAA charts, extensions may not line up with
  airport symbols on charts though Avare's accuracy has been tested.</p>

 <hr size="1">

 <h3 style="text-align: center;"><a name="0.1_NewStuff">New Features</a></h3>
 Recently introduced features include:<br>
 <br>

 • <span style="font-weight: bold;">Geo Referenced Approach Plates</span><br>
 Avare has 13000+ geo referenced approach plates for the US. Users may
 choose to geo reference the plates on their
 own. See <br>
 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhF3tAnuaIE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhF3tAnuaIE</a><br>
 User geo referenced plate information overrides the official
 geo referenced information. Users can revert back to the official
 information by using the "Clear" button.<br>
 <br>
 • <span style="font-weight: bold;">Glide Range</span><br>
 You can set the glide ratio of your aircraft in Preferences, and Avare
 will calculate your approximate glide range. All the airports shown in
 red color in the Near tab, will not be in glide range, while the ones
 shown in green will be in glide range. An example glide ratio (to be set in
 Preferences) for a C172 is calculated as:<br>
 glide ratio = POH glide distance per thousand feet = 1.25 nm per 1000 feet = 1.25 * 6076 feet / 1000 feet = 7.5.<br>
 <br>
 • <span style="font-weight: bold;">Emergency</span><br>
 You can declare an in flight emergency by pressing the Menu button, then the Emergency button. You will be asked to confirm. Press "Yes" button to declare an emergency.
 To send out a SMS text message to an emergency contact with your location, altitude, tail number etc., Set the appropriate values in Preferences under Pilot and Aircraft. Set Pilot Contact, Aircraft Tail Number, and Emergency Contact Number.
 To load emergency checklist, Set the appropriate values in Preferences under Pilot and Aircraft. Set Emergency Checklist Name. This name must match the name of a saved checklist under Lists.
 Your destination will be set to nearest airport. Depending on altitude, terrain, winds, obstacles, and aircraft, you may not be able to make it to that airport in an engine out emergency.<br>
 <br>
 • <span style="font-weight: bold;">Game TFRs</span><br>
 You can show Game TFRs on screen by downloading game TFRs from Download->Weather/TFRs. TFRs will be shown for games under progress, and for all games scheduled to begin in next 12 hours. Each TFR will be labeled with time in METAR time format, and with stadium label.
 You can hide game TFRs by deleting them from Download screen.<br>
 <br>
 • <span style="font-weight: bold;">Layers</span><br>
The Layer slide out button on the right side on Map screen allows users to select between METAR, Radar, and Plate layers. Layer is an overlay on the Map. To show METAR circles on airports, use the METAR Layer. To Show Radar weather over Map, use NEXRAD layer. To show approach plates on Map, use the Plate layer.<br>
 <br>
 • <span style="font-weight: bold;">CDI/VDI</span><br>
 They display position deviation from your planned path when a valid GPS lock is attained. They are enabled in the Preferences menu under the Display section. The CDI is operational when you have a destination set. The needle indicator at the bottom will move left/right of center based upon how off course your location you are. If you deviate more than one tick left or right then the indicator changes color - RED if you are left of course, GREEN if you are right. To correct, steer the aircraft in the direction of the arrow to bring it back to center.<br>
 <br>
 The VDI (Vertical Deviation Indicator) will display when you have a
 destination with a known elevation set and you are within 15nm of it.
 The indicator needle on the right of
 the bars is centered when you are on a 3 degree glideslope of your
 destination. Being "on the
 glideslope" is a range of 2.86 to 3.14 degrees. Anything greater than
 3.14 is considered "above" and will show the indicator in YELLOW.
 Anything below 2.86 is low, and the color is changed to
 RED. When you return to the programmed slope, the display will return
 to it's neutral GRAY. The VDI scale is 0.14 degree / division.<br>
 <br>
 <b>!!! CAUTION !!!</b> The VDI uses GPS altitude and general airport
 elevation. It is not an accurate VNAV / glide slope indicator to any
 specific runway at your destination. The CDI uses track heading and is
 not an accurate representaiton of your magnetic heading.<br>
 <br>
 • <span style="font-weight: bold;">Internet NEXRAD</span><br>
 To show Internet downloaded NEXRAD radar, go to Download, and download
 the NEXRAD images from Weather drop down list. In Preferences, select how
 you wish the NEXRAD to be displayed, and the latest NEXRAD will display
 on the Map screen.<br>
 <br>
 • <span style="font-weight: bold;">PFD</span><br>
 PFD shows a glass cockpit like setup for learning purposes. It should in no way be used in IMC.
 Use Preferences->Instrumentation->PFD Vertical Mount setting to change the device orientation for proper operation. The feature only works in portrait mode horizontal or vertical.
 If using in flight, you must understand that the following limitations make it extremely unreliable:
 1. It uses fusion on internal gyroscopes, compass, and accelerometers for pitch and roll. Cheap gyroscopes in mobile devices, if available, are not to aviation standards.
 The calibration of these gyroscopes are through internal accelerometers, which cause excessive acceleration errors in pitch.
 2. Heading is obtained from GPS track, and is ground track. Similarly rate of turn is from ground track, not from a gyroscope. Wind will cause deviations from correct value.
 3. No pressure transducers are available, hence VSI, altimeter, and airspeed indicators are obtained from GPS. In fact the ASI gauge is ground speed, not airspeed.
 4. Glide slope works to airports only.
 <br>
 • <span style="font-weight: bold;">ADS-B</span><br>
 You will need an ADS-B receiver, and will need to install the Avare
 External IO module from the Play store. Then, in Preferences, enable
 "Use ADS-B weather" to show ADS-B weather and radar images.<br>
 <br>
 • <span style="font-weight: bold;">Dynamic Fields</span><br>
 The top of the Map screen text lines can be configured to show any
 desired values out of speed, altitude, time, destination, timer,
 bearing, distance, and many more. To use dynamic fields, go to
 Prefernces, then enable "Use Dynamic Fileds". Then in the Map screen,
 double tap on the top text fields and choose the desired value to
 display at that location.<br>

 <br>
 • <span style="font-weight: bold;">Height Above Ground</span><br>
 Avare will display the approximate height above ground, in 3D screen, IF the user has downloaded the Terrain / Elevation maps for the
 area. The AGL value is approximate and should be used with caution.
 Types of error in the AGL include wrong MSL reported by the GPS, and
 quantization errors in the elevation charts.<br>
 <br>

 • <span style="font-weight: bold;">Six Second Trends</span><br>
 The top of the Map screen text lines can be configured to show speed, track, and altitude trends.
 These trends show speed, track, and altitude six seconds from now, if current flight characteristics are maintained.
 <br>
 <br>

 • <span style="font-weight: bold;">GPS coordinates</span><br>
 User may enter GPS coordinates for destination and Plan in decimal format (42d30'30"N,71d30'30"W) as 42.5083&-71.5083 or in equivalent degree minute second format as 423030N0713030W.
 <br>

 • <span style="font-weight: bold;">Vertical Descent / Climb Rate</span><br>
 Avare displays the optimum descent and climb rate to a destination,
 near the destination in feet per minute (fpm). If the destination is an
 airport, maintaing that rate will get the pilot to the pattern altitude.<br>
 <p>• <b>KML Tracks</b><br>Preferences allow you to Enable Tracking, and
  turn the display of your flight Track on or off. Any time you'd like to
  record your flight Track, just tap the Options button and then the
  "Tracks Off" indicator button. That will turn on the Track feature,
  which creates a Google Earth &amp; Google Maps compatible file on your
  device. Avare then periodically stores in this file the coded stream of
  text "bread crumb" location data from your active GPS receiver, and
  displays a Track connecting these bread crumbs on the Map view. To stop
  storing these bread crumbs, again tap Options and then "Tracks On" to
  see options and information regarding the file. Later you can view the
  file in Earth or Maps to "re-fly" your route.</p>

 <p>• <b>Distance &amp; Speed Rings</b><br>
  To see rings displayed on Map view for Time or Distance from your
  current GPS location, use Preferences to set the Style and Size of the
  rings.</p>

 <p>• <b>Civil Air Patrol CAP Grids</b><br>
  To see CAP grids and labels, use Preferences to enable CAP Grids.</p>

 <p>• <b>KML Reading</b><br>Now you can see your points of interest
  (POIs) on the Map using KML import. You can generate a KML files of
  your POIs using Google Earth. Once you have a KML file, place it in a
  folder of your choice accessible by Avare (like /sdcard). Go to
  "Preferences-&gt;Storage-&gt;User Defined Waypoints" then borwse to the
  folder containing your KML file (like /sdcard). Restart Avare, and then
  your POIs will appear on the Map screen. You can search your points of
  interest in Find tab, then add them to a flight plan, or directly go to
  them. You can place multiple KML files in the folder, and Avare will
  parse all these files to generate a combined view of your POIs.
  However, the user may only define 100 POIs in all files combined.<br>
 </p>

 <p>• <b>3D View</b><br>
  Note: This screen requires significant memory and processing power, and may crash / misbehave on older devices.
  To see charts in 3D, download elevation charts from the Download menu for your area. Charts and other data will be displayed under 3D tab.
  Move around on the 3D screen using touch. To check out 3D view of a destination you have not been to, use Simulation mode with Destination set to the destination.
  To see terrain clearance, use "Terrain" as chart type selection in 3D screen. Red terrain is above your altitude, and green terrain is 1000 feet below your altitude.
 <ul>
  <li>If the center button is gray, you are in Satellite Camera mode.</li>
  <li>Your aircraft will be located where green/blue/orange lines intersect.</li>
  <li>Several straight lines emerge from your aircraft to show your heading. Orange line shows your current track, and disappears under terrain higher than your altitude. Green line scans the terrain similarly.</li>
  <li>If you are receiving ADSB traffic, you will see other aircrafts with red/green wing colors that follow the nav lights convention.</li>
  <li>You will see obstacles in the area as red vertical lines.</li>
  <li>Your elevation AGL is shown when GPS is locked.</li>
  <li>Pinch with two fingers to zoom in and out. Pan left, right, up, and down with finger swipe. Rotate the map with two finger rotate.</li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li>If the center button is green, you are in Pilot Camera mode. You can get in/out of this mode by long pressing the center button.</li>
  <li>You will see as if you are looking out from the front wind screen of your aircraft. You will not see your own aircraft, but you will see a miniature orange aircraft as if you are looking at an AI.</li>
  <li>If you are receiving ADSB traffic, you will see other aircrafts with red and white wing colors that follow the Nav lights convention.</li>
  <li>You will see obstacles as red vertical lines.</li>
  <li>Your elevation AGL is shown when GPS is locked.</li>
  <li>Pinch with two fingers to zoom in and out. Look left, right, up, and down with finger swipe.</li>
  <li>Compare the device screen with your front wind screen to find the location of traffic in real world.</li>
 </ul>
 </p>

 <p>• <b>Fuel Tank Reminders</b><br>
  The fuel tank reminder is implemented as a display instrument that is selectable in any field of the top two status lines.
  To enable it, double tap the display field you wish to use for it, and select "Fuel Tank Switch Timer" from the list.
  The timer starts up at 30 minutes and will count down to zero. It is initially suspended/stopped.
  Single tap the display field to toggle start/stop the timer value. When the value reaches zero, a dialog is displayed
  indicating "Switch Fuel Tanks". You must hit the OK button to dismiss it. The timer will self-reset to 30 minutes to
  begin the cycle all over again.
  <br>
  The long press gesture on the fuel tank field will reset the countdown timer to 30 minutes.

 <p>• <b>Area Plates</b><br>
  Avare provides plates for the airports (US, Canada) that do not have airport diagrams available.
  You can download these plates from the Download menu, under the VFR Area Plates category.
  All these plates are Geo. referenced.
 </p>

>>>>>>> upstream/master
 <p>• <b>Flight Plan Course Line</b><br>
  The flight plan course line (if shown) is color coded. Legs drawn in white are ones that have
  yet to be flown. The magenta colored leg is the one currently active. Legs that have already been
  flown are drawn in gray.
 </p>

    <p>• <b>UI Configuration</b><br>
        You can turn on and off non essential parts of the UI. Go to Preferences->UI Configuration for this.
    </p>


    <p>• <b>Flight Plan Controls</b><br>
  While on the Map/Chart display tab, you now have the ability to show flight plan controls. There
  is an option under Preferences/Display/Show Flight Plan Controls. When enabled, 3 buttons will
  appear on the right edge of the map page when there is an active flight plan. The top button is a
  "rewind" image, it sets the next way point to the previous one in the plan - it is the same function
  as the "previous" button on the "Plan" tab. The middle button is a toggle for "pause/play" of the
  flight plan to control whether or not perform way point passage logic. When it is paused, way points
  are not automatically passed and the button will appear as a "pause" image. When active, it appears
  as the "play" button. The bottom button is a "fast forward" image that will advance the plan to the
  next way point in the sequence - same as "Next" on the "plan" tab..
 </p>

 <p>• <b>Loading and Displaying Esri Shape Files</b><br>
  Avare can load and display an Esri shape file (.shp) from the charts download folder. The user will place
  the shape file to be loaded in the charts download folder (the folder in which Avare stores its charts). The shape
  file name must be specified in Preferences->Display->Shape File Name. The user must then restart Avare to load the shape file.
  Avare can be restarted by restarting the device, by using Avare preference "Leave Running", or from Android App Settings.
  An example countries shape file can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.naturalearthdata.com/http//www.naturalearthdata.com/download/110m/cultural/ne_110m_admin_0_countries.zip">Natural Earth</a>.
  Note that large shape files may crash the app due to memory starvation.
 </p>

 <p>• <b>Sharing user data between devices</b><br>
  Users can share plans, lists, preferences, and recent airports between several devices using Avare built in Google Drive backup and restore functionality.
  In order to back up data (plans, lists, preferences, and recent airports) from a device, go to Preferences -> Application State -> Sync Data. Then after giving required permissions, press the backup button.
  In order to restore the backed up data, press the Restore button, then choose the backed up data file.
  Users can restore the backed up data from the device that created the data, or from a different device.
  Google Drive account is needed, and must be setup outside the app. Data downloaded from the server (charts, plates, A/FD) will not be backed up.
 </p>

 <p>• <b>Displaying NavAids near a point</b><br>
  On long-press, a section called "Position From Navaids" shows 4 closest navaids (VORs, NDBs) within a 150 miles radius.
  Based on current altitude, distance to the VOR is yellow if the point pressed is outside the VOR's service volume (see <a href="http://www.faraim.org/aim/aim-4-03-14-37.html">FAR AIM 1-1-8)</a>.
  If the listed navaid has HIWAS (Hazardous Inflight Weather Advisory Service) capability, an (H) superscript is printed next to the VOR identifier.
  This feature allows planning visual waypoints based on VOR radial crossing.

 <h3 style="text-align: center;"><a name="0.1_Diags">GPS Taxi on Airport
  Diagrams</a></h3>

 The <b>"GPS Taxi"</b> feature can display a location icon at your current
 GPS location on the FAA Airport Diagram for your current Destination airport.
 First you must Download the Airport Diagram for the airport where you'd like
 to use GPS Taxi, and of course GPS must be on with location acquired. Then
 select "AIRPORT-DIAGRAM" in the Plate screen.

 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Note:</b> While it can display your location,
  GPS Taxi on airport diagrams is <b>not "moving map"</b> so your location
  will not be automatically tracked at the center of the screen. Just scroll and
  pinch-zoom the Plate screen while on the airport with
  GPS On, to find the airplane icon tracking your current location.</p>

 <hr size="1"> <h3 style="text-align: center;"><a name="0.1_Landmarks">"Fly There"</a></h3>

 <p>You can select addresses and landmarks like "address,Statue Of Liberty" or "address,800 Boylston St
  Boston, MA 02199" <b>(without the quotes, and with "address," as prefix)</b> as your Destination in Avare. If you select
  a Destination in this way it's added to those listed in the Find screen just like airports,
  coordinates or other Destinations you've set in Avare. To use the Fly There feature you
  must be connected to the Internet before entering a new address. Once Avare
  decodes the address, it subsequently appears in the Find screen list, and then no Internet
  connection is required for navigation to it. Multiple addresses can be stored in the Find list.<br>
  Use the <b>Fly There</b> feature:</p>

 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>•With Avare's Find screen</b>. With an Internet
  connection, tap the Find button and in the Search box enter an address (or a location like "address,1 wtc"),
  and a pin icon appears in the list of Destinations. Tap the pin icon to select that as your Destination.

 </p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>•With Google Maps</b>, allowing you to
  see street and terrain maps and even satellite views when selecting a Destination. With an Internet
  connection:
 </p><ul><li>Launch the Google maps application on your device.</li>
  <li>Enter an address or landmark like "address,1 wtc" (no quotes).</li>
  <li>Google Maps will locate the landmark (or address), and put a red marker icon on it.</li><li>Activate the "Share" option in your version
   of Google Maps and select the Avare icon from the list of apps. Avare
   will set that address as Destination, and it will be in the Find list
   if you add other Destinations in any way.</li></ul>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">See the <a title="Find" href="#0.1_Find">Find</a></b> section
  above for more information on using the Find function.

 <hr size="1"> <h3 style="text-align: center;"><a name="0.1_Terrain">Terrain &amp; Proximity</a></h3>

 <p>•<b>Terrain Maps</b><br>Avare provides USGS terrain
  maps.  These maps can be downloaded from the download list under
  "Terrain".<br> </p>

 •<b>Shaded Relief Maps<br></b>Avare provides USGS
 shaded relief maps.  These maps can be downloaded from the
 download list under "Terrain".<br> <br> Note: Although the app may
 show the terrain and the relief maps expired after every new FAA
 cycle, there is usually very little change to the ground elevation for
 aviation purposes. Downloading of terrain maps for every FAA cycle is
 a waste of time and bandwidth.<br><br>

  <a name="0.1_Terminal">Procedures &amp; Graphical A/FDs</a></h3>

 The <b>Plate</b> screen shows any terminal procedure plates you
 have Downloaded. To see terminal procedures for an
 airport, simply enter it as Destination, then press the Plate screen
 button at the bottom of the screen. Select the appropriate procedure from
 the drop down list for that airport.

 <p>Plates are distributed in multiple files, one for each state.
  There are tens of thousands of procedures, making plate files large.
  For example, the Texas plates download size is about 300 MB. The Plate
  screen displays take off and alternate minimums, when downloaded.</p>

 The Plate files also contain complete pages from the green FAA A/FD book in an
 image format. Note that Avare's text A/FD is contained in the main Avare
 Database and does not require downloading the graphical A/FDs in the Plates files.

 <h3 style="text-align: center;"><a name="0.1_Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting<br>
 </a></h3>
 <h3 style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);"><strong> </strong></span></em></h3>
 <p>
  Among the few problems reported with Avare or any of our apps, three categories have emerged:</p>

 <p>1. <em>Incomplete installation</em>. Most of these problems have been
  related to internet connectivity problems during installation of the
  app, such as during download of the Database or charts for Avare. If you
  have problems with any of our apps, you might first try checking your
  internet connection and then deleting and re-installing the file(s) or
  the app itself.</p>

 <p>2. <em>Hardware problems</em>. Nearly all of these few cases have
  been traced to defective SD card chips. These problems can be very
  difficult to trace because they may occur randomly, intermittently, and
  with very strange symptoms. Basically the problems our apps encounter
  are akin to you carefully placing an important item in a cabinet and
  returning to find the cabinet locked, the item missing or damaged, or
  even the entire room missing only to magically reappear a moment later.
  If you encounter problems, one thing to try is testing, formatting, or
  replacing the memory chip if possible. Sometimes deleting and
  re-installing the app and all associated files will cure or change the
  problem at least temporarily if it shifts the location where the app and
  files are stored on the chip. You might be able to work around the
  problem by moving the app and files to a different chip (e.g. from
  device memory to SD card or vice versa). Generally the permanent
  solution for a defective memory chip is to replace the chip.</p>

 <p>3. <em>Software conflicts.</em> Another category of weird and
  intermittent problems arises from conflicts with other apps. Unlike
  nearly all apps currently available for Android, our apps use only the
  bare minimum of Permissions required for operation. Apps you have
  installed from other developers may use Permissions that enable them to
  automatically launch their app, display ads, collect and use your
  personal information or do other operations in the background even when
  you’re not using their app. Such activity by those apps can cause
  strange and intermittent problems with other apps. <em>Usually</em>, the
  apps that come pre-installed on your device won’t cause such problems.
  Something to try if you have problems with any of our apps, is to
  disable or uninstall other apps you’ve installed on your device. You
  might also try a virus scanner from a reputable provider, keeping in
  mind that some anti-virus apps from disreputable providers have
  themselves been used to install a virus.</p>

 <h3 style="text-align: left;">Canada Topo Grid </h3>As far North as 60N covered.<br>
 <br>
 We are investigating the potential for adding more capabilities for
 flying Avare in Canada. It would be helpful if anyone interested in
 this topic would post a message on our Forum, so we can gauge how many
 of our users fly Avare in Canada and would like to see more
 capabilities added. Also what specific capabilities might be most
 useful.<br>
 <br>
 Clearly, having official Canadian charts and data would be very popular
 and helpful, but to date we have been unable to obtain free materials
 of that kind.<br>
 <br>
 To fly Avare in Canada as of this writing (October 8, 2014), be sure
 you go to Map, Options, Preferences, Display, and turn on Show All
 Bases. That enables you to Find any Canadian destination that is in
 Avare's database and fly GPS direct even without any map displayed. To
 display a Canadian map, in the Download menu near the bottom is a
 category currently named "Topographic Maps(42)" which currently only
 contains Canada Grid maps numbered 1-114. To find out which grid map(s)
 you need for the area you fly, consult this map.<br>
 <br>
 In the current version of Avare, you might encounter some difficulty in
 switching between U.S. charts and Canadian Topo. If so, it might help
 to use Simulation mode if your current position is not in Canada. If
 that does not help you might also Exit and restart Avare. We very much
 want to improve and add more Canadian capabilities in Avare, but
 receive very little feedback and few inquiries. If you fly Avare in
 Canada or would like to, please contact us on our Forum.<br>

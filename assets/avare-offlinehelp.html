<h3 style="text-align: center;">Notice</h3>
All GPS applications on any <b>handheld non-certified devices</b> like
smartphones and tablets are <b><em>not approved by the FAA for IFR</em></b> flights. 
None of the operating systems on such devices are tested according to rigorous 
FAA standards, hence any software running on them is unfit for 
use as a primary flight navigation tool. It is unwise to solely rely 
on any such device or any app running on one, during the critical 
phases of a flight.
<p>
Please do not download any charts/plates that you do not need. Downloading 
only the needed files will help us keep server hosting costs down, which along 
with donations helps us keep Avare and chart updates free to all. Thank you.
</p>
The user must ensure that Avare is always updated to the latest
version, and <b>ensure that all Avare databases and charts are kept current</b>.
If Avare and its databases and charts are not of the exact same
version, the GPS position displayed may be inaccurate, because <b>the FAA
sometimes changes the format</b> of their materials. Avare does not
automatically fetch any databases and charts when they are expired, so
it is the user's sole responsibility to update any expired charts and
databases. To do so, ensure that your device has an internet connection and
then just <b>press the Map, Options, Download and Update buttons</b> in Avare.<br>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><a name="0.1_Quick">Quick Start</a> -
Intro<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><br style="font-weight: bold;"> </h3>

<p>•When you first launch Avare, after reading the disclaimer
just click OK if you agree to the terms. Before using Avare the first time,
you must have an internet connection on your device (WiFi or Data) to
Download the free Database and at least one of the free charts. Later you can add any airport diagrams, 
terminal procedures, and other files you'll need. <b>Please get only the materials you
need</b> because downloading all available materials will use both your
online resources and ours, overloading our servers. Help us keep Avare
and the FAA resources free for all users.</p>

<p>To get these free resources: Press the <b>Options button</b> (square button on
the lower left side of the Map screen), press the Download button,
select one or more items you need from the list,
then press the Get button to begin downloading. <i>Note that the Option
button is only available in the Map view, so if you don't see it just
press the Map button at bottom-left first and Options will appear
above it.</i> When you're
done Downloading, just hit the Back key on your device to see the
Map view. After doing this, no data connection is required to use any of the
materials you've downloaded with Avare.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Notes: 
</p><ul><li>New charts and
features are being added frequently, so check often to ensure that you
have the latest Avare version and Downloads. In the Downloads screen,
any categories containing items that are outdated will be shown in red.
Any red items indicate that you need to ensure your device has an
internet connection and then press the <b>Update</b> button.
</li>

<li>Sometimes after installing or
upgrading Avare,
you may be taken to the Download screen
automatically. After pressing Update to ensure that the Databases file and 
any other materials you need are current (green Checkmark), press the 
Back key to exit to the Map screen.</li>

<li>If you forgot to ensure that GPS
is on in your device's Settings, Avare may remind you to do that
because it is unable to display your position accurately without GPS.
To possibly speed up internal GPS acquisition on some devices, you 
can ensure that all services (WiFi, cell service, and data) are at least 
temporarily turned on too. Once required data has been Downloaded
and GPS location has been acquired, Avare works fine in "Airplane
Mode" with cell and data service turned off and only GPS turned on.</li></ul>


<p>•<b>Move around</b> or change zoom on the
Sectionals simply by holding a point on the chart and dragging or two
finger pinching, just like when viewing photos on your device. If your
version of Avare displays a minus/plus rocker button when you press
the Options button, that will provide extended zoom capability by
changing the zoom range available using the pinch zoom method.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Note: Either the default horizontal
Landscape or vertical Portrait mode display is available, selected in 
Preferences.</p>

<p>•The square <b>Center</b> button at the 
bottom-center of the screen will center the location icon and continue 
tracking your current GPS location (if the GPS is on and has acquired
your location) on the "moving map" chart.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Note: While GPS is acquired in Avare, 
the map will constantly track from your currently displayed location. 
This is very handy in flight, because you can drag the map to place the 
location indicator icon at any spot on the screen (or even completely off
the screen) and the map will continue tracking beneath it. So for example 
if you are flying northwest, you can put the location icon at the southeast 
corner of the screen and see a greater distance ahead on the map at any 
given zoom level. To instantly center your location icon again, just press 
the Center button.</p>

<p>•The "<b>Pan</b>" (Pan/Draw) button allows you to jot quick 
notes on charts. In the Maps screen, tap the Pan button at the lower-right.
When the Pan button changes to the Draw button, the charts will 
not pan, and the Map screen becomes a touch operated pen for writing or
drawing on charts. Draw or write notes on the screen with your finger. 
Notes length is limited due to memory size.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">To erase all notes and drawings in Draw 
mode, long press the screen and then press the <b>Clear</b> button
that appears.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">To temporarily hide your notes/drawings and return to
normal Map functioning (Pan mode), just tap the Draw (Pan) button again.</p>

<p>•<b>Long-press</b> any point on the chart (with GPS
acquired) to display text at the top of the screen giving
approximate compass direction and distance<b>From</b>,
followed by exact GPS bearing<b>To</b>, that point in relation to
your GPS location. Very handy when contacting ATC or making CTAF
calls!</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Note:</b> The current <b>Destination</b> used
by Avare for various features can be set after a long-press on the chart. Just tap either
the button that pops out containing the name or coordinates of the location you pressed;
or the button that pops out containing the word "Plan" to send that Destination to the
<a title="Flight Plan" href="#0.1_Plan"><b>Plan</b></a> feature.

<a name="0.1_Find"></a>
</p><p>•The "<b>Find</b>" button in the bottom Menu
activates a search box for a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">3-digit</span> 
Destination Airport code (or Navaid code, Fix code, etc.) 
that Avare uses to display a course, bearing, etc. This
code also determines the Destination airport Avare uses when you display A/FD
info. If you do not remember the airport code for an airport,
enter part of its facility name to search for it. Avare offers some capability 
for offline facility search (try using just the first letter and
scrolling down through the list) and when online, Avare automatically taps into 
Google Maps if needed to search for airports and even cities or complete street 
addresses (see "<b><a title="Fly To" href="#0.1_Landmarks">Fly There</a></b>"
in the Help menu above). You can also specify radial/DME pairs in
destination like BOS275010 for BOS VOR, 275 degree radial, 10 miles.<br>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>To input a Destination
airport</b>, just tap the Find button in the Menu and then input the
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>three</b></span> 
digit airport code (example: LAX, <em>not</em> KLAX).</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Note that a selection list of your
recently input Destination codes is displayed before you
begin to input a new one. Familiar symbols are used to indicate the various
types of Destination codes such as VORs and intersections. Airports have an
empty round symbol. For convenience in selecting VORs, etc., airports are 
sorted toward the bottom since they can be quickly selected with a long-press 
in Map view.</p> 

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>
To Delete a Destination</b>, from the list of
previously used destinations in the search list, long-press it, and a
list of buttons will appear. Select "Delete" to delete that
destination.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>To clear a 
Destination</b> once it has been set,
long press at the destination in Map view. A "Delete" button will 
appear. Press the "Delete" button to clear the currently set 
destination.<br> </p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Note that when there is no Destination set,
the <b>current chart name</b> may be displayed at the top-left (e.g. "Los Angeles"
to indicate that Avare's currently displayed location is on the LA Sectional).

</p><p>•Press the <b>Options button</b> (square button on
the lower left side of the Map screen), and a list of
buttons for additional features and Preferences will appear.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">≡ The "<b>Preferences</b>" 
button in the Options list
displays a list where you can choose among available Preferences
(details below).</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">≡ The <b>Help</b> button 
in the Options list activates a
web browser app to display in-app Help with a few links to online resources. 
Press the Back key on your Android device to return to Avare.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">≡ There may be an <b>Extended 
Zoom</b> (- +) button in 
the Options list, that enables you to extend the zoom range provided by using
the normal two-finger pinch zoom feature.

</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">≡ The <b>North Up/Track Up</b> 
button in the Options list
provides some capability to change the map display orientation. Because
Avare uses the free official FAA charts, text on the charts will rotate along
with the chart.

</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">≡ The <b>Navigate/Simulation</b> 
button in the Options list 
toggles Avare's use of GPS for positioning the map. In the default Navigate mode,
if GPS is on and location is acquired Avare will track your location.

</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">≡ The <b>Chart Type</b> 
button in the Options list 
shows the chart type currently displayed. Sectional is the default.

</p><p><b>•To browse charts</b> freely without reference
to your GPS location, press the Options button, tap the Preferences
button, and select <b>Simulation Mode</b>.
Then you can zoom in or out, scroll and pan freely, or quickly zip to
any location simply by inputting a Destination as described
above. </p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Notes: Simulation Mode works without any need for
cell or data access or GPS. If GPS is on and has acquired a "lock" on
your location, it will retain lock in Simulation Mode while Avare is active and the
device is on. This is helpful because once internal GPS is lost, some
devices won't re-acquire without a cell or WiFi signal (such as when aloft in many
areas). In Simulation Mode, Find will center the
chart display at the airport code you input, and you can then browse
from there or input another airport code. After browsing, to re-center the map on
the current Destination (if any is set), just tap the Center button. When you use 
Preferences to turn Simulation Mode off again, the display will return to your 
current GPS location if available.</p>

<b>•To track a course to destination</b> enter a
destination, and a magenta great circle route will appear from your current 
GPS location to that destination. Once set, the magenta route line doesn't
move with the aircraft location. A dashed black and white Destination
track line shows the current bearing to the destination. A red dashed line 
shows the current aircraft ground track. Align the two dashed lines with the solid
magenta line for the shortest route to your Destination. If your location
has diverged from the magenta course line you can use Find to re-select 
your Destination. You can also just fly so that the two dashed lines are
superimposed in alignment.

<p><b><i>Main Avare Screens</i></b><br>
The main screens in Avare are selected via the<b>Menu</b> 
row of buttons across the bottom:</p>

<p>•The "<b>Map</b>" Button in the Menu at the bottom of the
screen displays the currently selected chart type at the current location. Map is the
default screen in Avare, and will often be displayed when using the Back key on
your device from within another Avare screen such as the Find screen.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Note: if Avare is unable to acquire your GPS
position or you have no Destination
selected, a black screen may be displayed. If so, you can display a chart by using
Preferences to select Simulation Mode and then using Find to select a Destination
that is on a chart you have previously installed via Download.</p>

<p>•The "<b>Plate</b>" Button in the Menu at the bottom of the
screen displays the FAA airport diagrams, and terminal procedures for
the currently selected Destination airport.<br> </p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>To view an Airport Diagram (AD)</b> 
first Download the collection of ADs that covers the location of your intended Destination.
For example, "California" for LAX. 
Then input the Destination airport code in the Find screen as described above (or using 
long-press on an airport in the Map screen), then tap the "Plates" Button, then select
"AIRPORT-DIAGRAM" from the drop down list and Avare will display it, 
provided that you have Downloaded the relevant AD file and the FAA
provides a diagram for your selected Destination airport. 
Note that the "<b>GPS Taxi</b>" feature in Avare can indicate your current
location on an airport (see details in the Airport Diagram section of Avare's Help). </p>

<p>•The "<b>A/FD</b>" Button in the Menu at the bottom of the screen
displays the airport info for the currently selected Destination
airport in text format.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">To get airport
<b>(A/FD) text info</b>, first input a Destination airport in Map view as
described above, then tap the "A/FD" Button and scroll through the info. Note that
if you have Downloaded the "A/FD Images" file for your Destination airport (e.g. 
"A/FD SW" for LAX), the drop down A/FD bar on the top of the A/FD screen is 
used to select between the text and graphical versions of the A/FD. The regional 
graphical A/FD files are typically quite large, but can provide information beyond 
what's contained in the smaller FAA text version that covers all FAA regions and is 
included in Avare's required Databases file.<br> </p>

<p>•The "<b>Find</b>" Button in the Menu at the bottom 
of the screen enables you to search for a Destination airport, VOR or 
waypoint.<br> </p>

<p>•The "<b>WX</b>" Button in the Menu at the bottom 
of the screen provides some of Avare's current Weather options.

</p><p>•The "<b>Plan</b>" Button in the Menu at the bottom 
of the screen enables you to do limited flight planning online or offline in 
flight (see details in that section of this Help file). </p>

<p>•The "<b>Near</b>" button in the Menu will display
a selectable list of airports nearest to your current GPS location.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">To use the Near feature, first ensure
that GPS is on and has acquired your location, then press the Near Button
at the bottom of the screen. The airports are listed by increasing
distance with nearest at the top. Each airport's name, code, distance,
bearing, and 100LL fuel (if available) is displayed (Jet A may be
shown as "A" alone, or as 100LLA indicating availability of both
fuels).

</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">Note: To select an airport on the list
as Avare's current <b>Destination</b>, simply press the name
of that airport and then press the button that pops out, to select the code
displayed on that button as your Destination.</p>

<p>•The "<b>GPS</b>" Button in the Menu at the bottom 
of the screen enables you to monitor the current status of the GPS system 
currently in use by Avare on your device. Note that this differs from the
GPS/Simulation button that selects whether Avare is currently using 
GPS to display your current location.</p>

<hr size="1">
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><a name="0.1_Help">Help</a>
- More Intro</h3>

<p>•<b>Text information</b> is displayed at the top of the 
Map display screen, when your GPS position is acquired
and you have input a valid Destination. 

</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">In the top row: Destination (or chart
name if no Destination is selected) at the left; Distance from GPS location, time
to Destination direct at current GPS speed, GPS bearing to
Destination at the right.

</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">In the second row: GPS elevation
 MSL at the left; GPS ground speed and GPS 
heading at the right.</p>

<p>•<b>GPS Status</b> information is available from
the Map screen by pressing the Options button and tapping the "GPS"
button so that a black "target" screen appears. This feature is
helpful in positioning your GPS device for best reception, and in 
troubleshooting any GPS problems. At the
top-left is the GPS time and number of satellites acquired. 
The current Lat/Long locations, and an estimate of the location 
accuracy are also displayed. The target display simulates the relative 
strength (size of each indicator circle) and relative
locations of satellites acquired. To close the GPS screen and return
to the Map display press the Back key on your device.</p>

<p>•<b>TFRs</b> that you have recently fetched using 
Update in Download via internet from the FAA are automatically 
displayed as red graphics on charts by default. If you long-press 
the red indicator at the top-center of a TFR shape, text for that TFR will be 
displayed at the top of the screen. It is user's responsibility to Update the
latest TFRs from the download list under the Databases group.</p>

<p>•<b>Runway Extensions</b> (if set in Preferences) 
show 6 degree approach
to all runways at the airport currently set as Destination. Note that
due to variations in the FAA charts, extensions may not line up with
airport symbols on charts though Avare's accuracy has been tested.</p>

<hr size="1">

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><a name="0.1_NewStuff">New Features</a></h3>
Recently introduced features include:<br>
<br>
• <span style="font-weight: bold;">Internet NEXRAD</span><br>
To show Internet downloaded NEXRAD radar, go to Download, and download
the NEXRAD images from Weather drop down list. In Preferences, enable
"Show Nexrad", and the latest NEXRAD will display on the Map screen.<br>
<br>
• <span style="font-weight: bold;">ADS-B</span><br>
You will need an ADS-B receiver, and will need to install the Avare
External IO module from the Play store. Then, in Preferences, enable
"Use ADS-B weather" to show ADS-B weather and radar images.<br>
<br>
• <span style="font-weight: bold;">Dynamic Fields</span><br>
The top of the Map screen text lines can be configured to show any
desired values out of speed, altitude, time, destination, timer,
bearing, distance, and many more. To use dynamic fields, go to
Prefernces, then enable "Use Dynamic Fileds". Then n the Map screen,
double tap on the top text fields and choose the desired value to
display at that location.<br>

<br>
• <span style="font-weight: bold;">Height Above Ground</span><br>
Avare will display the approximate height above ground, below the
aircraft
icon, IF the user has downloaded the Terrain / Elevation maps for the
area. The AGL value is approximate and should be used with caution.
Types of error in the AGL include wrong MSL reported by the GPS, and
quantization errors in the elevation charts.<br>
<br>
• <span style="font-weight: bold;">Vertical Descent / Climb Rate</span><br>
Avare displays the optimum descent and climb rate to a destination,
near the destination in feet per minute (fpm). If the destination is an
airport, maintaing that rate will get the pilot to the pattern altitude.<br>
<p>• <b>KML Tracks</b><br>Preferences allow you to Enable Tracking, and
turn the display of your flight Track on or off. Any time you'd like to
record your flight Track, just tap the Options button and then the
"Tracks Off" indicator button. That will turn on the Track feature,
which creates a Google Earth &amp; Google Maps compatible file on your
device. Avare then periodically stores in this file the coded stream of
text "bread crumb" location data from your active GPS receiver, and
displays a Track connecting these bread crumbs on the Map view. To stop
storing these bread crumbs, again tap Options and then "Tracks On" to
see options and information regarding the file. Later you can view the
file in Earth or Maps to "re-fly" your route.</p>

<p>• <b>Distance &amp; Speed Rings</b><br>
To see rings displayed on Map view for Time or Distance from your
current GPS location, use Preferences to set the Style and Size of the
rings.</p>

<hr size="1">

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><a name="0.1_Diags">GPS Taxi on Airport
Diagrams</a></h3>

The <b>"GPS Taxi"</b> feature can display a location icon at your current
GPS location on the FAA Airport Diagram for your current Destination airport.
First you must Download the Airport Diagram for the airport where you'd like
to use GPS Taxi, and of course GPS must be on with location acquired. Then 
select "AIRPORT-DIAGRAM" in the Plate screen.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Note:</b> While it can display your location,
GPS Taxi on airport diagrams is <b>not "moving map"</b> so your location 
will not be automatically tracked at the center of the screen. Just scroll and 
pinch-zoom the Plate screen while on the airport with
GPS On, to find the airplane icon tracking your current location.</p>

<hr size="1"> <h3 style="text-align: center;"><a name="0.1_Landmarks">"Fly There"</a></h3>

<p><a name="0.1_Landmarks">You can select addresses and landmarks like "address,Statue Of Liberty" or "address,800 Boylston St  
Boston, MA 02199" <b>(without the quotes, and with "address," as prefix)</b> as your Destination in Avare. If you select
a Destination in this way it's added to those listed in the Find screen just like airports,
coordinates or other Destinations you've set in Avare. To use the Fly There feature you 
must be connected to the Internet before entering a new address. Once Avare
decodes the address, it subsequently appears in the Find screen list, and then no Internet 
connection is required for navigation to it. Multiple addresses can be stored in the Find list.<br>
Use the <b>Fly There</b> feature:</a></p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a name="0.1_Landmarks"><b>•With Avare's Find screen</b>. With an Internet

<p>The Plan screen allows you to create and follow a basic
flight plan with multiple waypoints. Waypoints are listed in the Plan, 
along with the total distance and time calculated from the
current postion to the final way point.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>To Create a Flight Plan with Single Line Input<br>
</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Press the Plan tab, and enter a sentence of waypoints, separated by
a single space like "KJFK KSBA" in the Plan box.<br>
</li><li>Press the "Plan" button to load the plan.<br>
</li><li>Any waypoints not recognized, will be omitted.<br>
</li>
  <li>Example: To make a plan from Beverly Airport (KBVY) to Manchester
Airport (KMHT) via the NUVZA fix, and Lawrence VOR (LWM), enter "KBVY NUVZA LWM KMHT".<br>
  </li>
</ul>
 

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>To Create a Flight Plan</b></p>
<ul> <li>Press the Find button, and enter a location like "JFK" in the 
Search box, and an empty round airport icon appears in the list of locations 
matching JFK.</li>
<li>Long-press the airport icon, and some buttons will appear.</li>
<li>Tap the Plan button to add JFK airport to the plan.</li> 
<li>Repeat this process to add your remaining waypoints to the end 
of the plan.</li></ul> 

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>To Activate Your Plan</b>
</p><ul><li>Simply press the Activate button on the Plan screen, then press the Map button.</li>
<li>Selecting a temporary Destination will automatically disable the flight
plan, but you can re-activate it in the Plan screen.</li>
<li>If you navigate to within 2nm of a waypoint Avare will register an automatic
station passage, and the Plan bar will move to the next waypoint.</li> </ul>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Note: When a plan is active, Destination will be set 
to the next way point. All information in the A/FD and Plates will be set to the 
next waypoint, and not to the final destination.</p>

<hr size="1"> <h3 style="text-align: center;"><a name="0.1_Terrain">Terrain &amp; Proximity</a></h3>

<p>•<b>Terrain Maps</b><br>Avare provides USGS terrain
maps.  These maps can be downloaded from the download list under
"Terrain".<br> </p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Terrain maps show elevation around your
current position.  Visible areas are at or above your GPS
calculated altitude.  Black areas are below your current GPS
altitude. Note that GPS altitude is not accurate. Give good margin of
error to the calculations.<br> </p> •<b>Proximity
Processing<br></b>The left sliding bar is slaved to the GPS
altitude, and moves as the GPS altitude changes in relationship with
your true altitude.  However, you can move this bar temporarily,
to simulate climbing or descending. As you move this bar, ground
proximity is redrawn to show the relationship of ground elevation
around your current position to the indicated altitude on top left in
FL.<br> <br>

•<b>Shaded Relief Maps<br></b>Avare provides USGS
shaded relief maps.  These maps can be downloaded from the
download list under "Terrain".<br> <br> Note: Although the app may
show the terrain and the relief maps expired after every new FAA
cycle, there is usually very little change to the ground elevation for
aviation purposes. Downloading of terrain maps for every FAA cycle is
a waste of time and bandwidth.<br><br>

<a name="0.1_Terminal">Procedures &amp; Graphical A/FDs</a></h3>

The <b>Plate</b> screen shows any terminal procedure plates you
have Downloaded. To see terminal procedures for an
airport, simply enter it as Destination, then press the Plate screen
button at the bottom of the screen. Select the appropriate procedure from
the drop down list for that airport.

<p>Plates are distributed in multiple files, one for each state. 
There are tens of thousands of procedures, making plate files large.
For example, the Texas plates download size is about 300 MB. The Plate 
screen displays take off and alternate minimums, when downloaded.</p>

The Plate files also contain complete pages from the green FAA A/FD book in an
image format. Note that Avare's text A/FD is contained in the main Avare 
Database and does not require downloading the graphical A/FDs in the Plates files.
